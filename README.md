This is a game of luck. The player with the closest number to the target number wins.

<p>HOW IT WORKS</p>
<ul>
  <li>The computer generates a "Target Number" which is displayed at the top of both players' screens.</li>
  <li>On the right is the human player's screen where they choose a number from 0 to 9 using the plus and minus controls.</li>
  <li>On the left is the computer player's screen where it makes a guess from 0 to 9.</li>
  <li>The player whose number is closest to the "Target Number" wins.</li>
  <li>To play again, click the "Next Round" button below both players' screens and choose a number like you did before.</li>
</ul>
